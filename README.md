## How to play Planetz:

The game is still incomplete but can be played by importing the project file "project.godot" into the Godot game engine editor. It may take a few minutes for the game engine to reimport assets, so please be patient. I have also included a Windows executable "Planetz.exe" that should run on recent versions of Windows.

## Commands (Also displayed in the game):

* To quit press the Escape key.
* To engage thrusters press Spacebar.
* Apply brakes with the Z key.
* To pitch the spacecraft use the Up/Down arrow keys.
* To yaw (rotate side to side) use the Left/Right arrow keys.
* To roll the spacecraft use the N and M keys.
* Visit Earth with the E key.
* Visit the Moon with the W key.
* Visit the Sun with the S key.
* Visit Mars with the Q key.
* Visit Mercury with the A key.
* Visit Venus with the D key.

## The Code:
Most of the game code is written in GDScript or with Godot's built in visual shader language. Code is contained in *.gd* files and scene description files with the *.tscn* extension.
